Take one of your files containing a working program, say sea.c, and rename
the file sea.  Now try and compile it.  Some C compilers will complain;
others will not.  On UNIX systems, the complaint may be quite cryptic, with
words such as bad magic number or unable to process using elf libraries.
What happens on your system?

tyrion$~: gcc sea
/usr/bin/ld:sea: file format not recognized; treating as linker script
/usr/bin/ld:sea:1: syntax error
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
tyrion$~:
